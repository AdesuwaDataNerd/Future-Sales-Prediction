# Future Sales Prediction with Linear Regression and Random Forest

This project focuses on predicting future sales using two machine learning models: Linear Regression and Random Forest. The goal is to analyze historical sales data and forecast future sales trends. By comparing the performance of Linear Regression and Random Forest, the project aims to provide insights into the effectiveness of these models for sales prediction in a retail environment.

## Key Features
- Utilizes Linear Regression and Random Forest models for sales prediction.
- Analyzes historical sales data to identify trends and patterns.
- Compares the performance of both models to determine their suitability for the task.

## Introduction

Accurate sales prediction is essential for inventory management and business planning in the retail industry. This project employs machine learning techniques, specifically Linear Regression and Random Forest, to predict future sales based on historical data. The models consider various factors influencing sales, providing valuable insights for decision-making.

### Why Linear Regression and Random Forest?

Linear Regression provides a straightforward approach to modeling the relationship between input features and sales. On the other hand, Random Forest is capable of capturing complex patterns and interactions in the data. The comparison between these models helps determine which is better suited for the specific sales prediction task.

### Goals

- Implement Linear Regression and Random Forest models for future sales prediction.
- Utilize historical sales data to train and evaluate the models.
- Compare the performance of Linear Regression and Random Forest using relevant metrics.
- Provide actionable insights for improving sales forecasting in the retail sector.
